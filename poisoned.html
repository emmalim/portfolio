                    <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
                    <p><em>Poisoned (2022)</em> is the second project I created for CS 321: Extended Reality. You have been poisoned (oh no!) and must travel through town to collect ingredients for an antidote before it’s too late. <em>Poisoned</em> was created using Unity over the course of 6 weeks in collaboration with Kate MacVicar '23. For this project, I focused on how I could tell a narrative in VR without using traditional storytelling methods.</p>
                    <p><b>Tools:</b> Unity Game Engine &#8226; SteamVR</p>
                        
                    <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>

                        <h4>PART 1: PLANNING &amp; 3D MODELING</h4>
                        <p>During the planning portion of the project, I focused on how I could utilize sound, visuals, and your environment to tell a narrative in VR. I also wanted to make more of this project my own by including assets I built myself. The cottage, bridge, city/dock buildings, and market stalls were modeled by my partner and I in Probuilder.</p>

                        <h4>PART 2: SCRIPTING</h4>
                        <p>Most of my contributions to this project was scripting functionality such as the inventory appearing/disappearing, counting items when they are added or removed from the inventory, and the death timer. You can <a id="textLink" href="https://github.com/emmalim/poisoned">access the scripts from my Poisoned GitHub repository</a>.</p>

                        <h4>PART 3: IN-CLASS DEMO &amp; USER FEEDBACK</h4> 
                        <p>We had the opportunity to receive peer feedback from an in-class demo and responded to the feedback by making adjustments to the experience. Thanks to peer feedback, the final version of <em>Poisoned</em> is now smaller and has a payment system (at the market and the shop).</p>

                        <h4>PART 4: FOR FUTURE ITERATIONS</h4> 
                        <p>Due to time constraints with the project deadline, my partner and I were unable to implement as much functionality as we had hoped. Here are some of the features that we hope to implement in future iterations of <em>Poisoned</em>.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Death vignette: </b>Originally, death in <em>Poisoned</em> was supposed to be shown gradually with a black vignette closing in on the camera as time in the experience progresses. Due to issues animating  Unity’s post-processing profile, we were unable to include this mechanic in the final version of the project. Instead, the camera suddenly turns to black so you are unable to see or interact with the environment anymore. I feel that the sudden death can be disorienting and take away a key component of the experience: being able to understand how much time you have left. We made the intentional choice to not include a health bar because that game component is more suitable to traditional non-VR games.</li>
                            <li><b>Inventory system: </b>The current inventory system is attached to the front of the Player object, meaning that while it does follow you when you teleport through the environment, it is in a fixed position and does not follow if you look to the left or right. This is something that I would like to improve in future iterations of this project to make accessing the inventory more convenient and efficient.</li>
