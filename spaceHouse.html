                    <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
                    
                    <p><em>Space House (2022)</em> is the first of 2 projects I developed for CS 321: Extended Reality, Wellesley College’s virtual reality course that teaches students how to develop 3D VR games using Unity Game Engine and C# scripting. I worked with Julie Lely '23 over the course of 7 weeks to create Space House, an interactive VR experience that allows the player to travel between a house and a planetarium.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Tools:</b> Unity Game Engine &#8226; SteamVR</p>
                    
                    <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                    <div class="develop">
                        <h4>PART 1: IMPLEMENTING INTERACTIVITY</h4> 
                        <p>The initial idea for this project was to create an immersive virtual space that would be calming to the player. The “Sensory House”, as it was called in its beginning stages, would be an environment where the player could travel through 4 rooms of a house, each with a different calming effect or activity. The first part of this assignment was to begin building an environment and implement interactable objects so I created our “house” (which was really a hallway with a room on each end) and had a door that led to the outside of the house. For our first in-class project demo, my partner and I developed the “nature room” outside the hallway, where the player could stack rocks.</p>

                        <h4>PART 2: ADDING THE PLANETARIUM AND AUDIO</h4>
                        <p>The next 2 weeks were spent building a planetarium where you could interact with the planets. I learned how to animate objects in Unity and implemented animation into the scene by having the planets rotate. To prepare for our second in-class demo, I included audio and text into the project.</p>

                        <h4>PART 3: REDESIGN AND SCRIPTING</h4> 
                        <p>Most of the development of the final version of Space House was done during the final 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks, I learned how to script using C# and how to create custom button bindings to the VR controllers. After the second round of in-class demos, my partner and I decided to change the format of our scene to make the experience more cohesive. Rather than having a long hallway with multiple rooms, we decided to have a one-room house where the player can interact with a TV and instantly teleport from the house to the planetarium. To implement this, I scripted a teleport mechanic, a toggle system to play/pause the TV, and a shooting mechanic so you can shoot meteors once you are in the planetarium.</p>
