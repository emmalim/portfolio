                    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                    <p><em>Space House (2022)</em> is the first project I developed for CS 321: Extended Reality, Wellesley’s Virtual Reality course that teaches students how to develop 3D VR games using Unity Game Engine and C# scripting. I worked with Julie Lely ‘23 over the course of 7 weeks to create Space House, an interactive VR experience that allows the player to travel between a house and a planetarium. After the initial 7 week period of the assignment, I further developed the experience to make it more educational. When the player interacts with the planets in the planetarium, they are now able to learn more about each planet.</p><br>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p><b>Part 1:</b> As any project begins, Space House began with an idea. Our initial idea was to create an immersive virtual space that would be calming to the player. The “Sensory House”, as it was called in its beginning stages, would be an environment where the player could travel through 4 rooms of a house, each with a different calming effect or activity. The first part of this assignment was to begin building an environment and implement interactable objects so we created our “house” (which was really a hallway with a room on each end) and had a door that led to the outside of the house. For our first in-class project demo, Julie and I developed the “nature room” outside the hallway, where the player could stack rocks.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Part 2:</b> The next 2 weeks were spent building a planetarium where the player could interact with the planets. We were taught how to animate objects in Unity and implemented animation into our scene by having the planets rotate. To prepare for our second in-class demo, we incorporated audio and text into our project.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Part 3:</b> Most of the development of the current version of Space House was done during the final 2 weeks. During these 2 weeks, we learned how to script using C# and how to create custom button bindings to the VR controllers. After the second round of in-class demos, Julie and I decided to change the format of our scene to make our story more cohesive. Rather than having a long hallway with multiple rooms, we decided to have a one-room house where the player can interact with a TV and instantly teleport from the house to the planetarium. To implement this, we scripted a teleport mechanic, a toggle system to play/pause the TV, and a shooting mechanic so the player can shoot meteors once they are in the planetarium.</p>
