                    <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
                    
                    <p>Sellesley is the culmination of what I learned in CS 220 (Human-Computer Interaction). It is prototype of a mobile app that seeks to address the problem of inconvenience in buying and selling items on Wellesley College campus. Current available methods, such as Free &amp; For Sale (a Facebook group where students can post items they are trying to sell or in search for), campus craft fairs, Amazon, and retail stores are time-consuming, complicated, far, unorganized, and/or confusing. Our mission was to design a mobile application that poses as a single solution for our target population: Wellesley students who need a better way to buy and sell on campus. Throughout the 12 weeks of developing this project, I designed, prototyped, user-tested, and evaluated UIs to create several iterations of Sellesley's UI.</p>

                        </div>
                        
                        <p>As Sellesley caters to an audience at Wellesley College, I interviewed four Wellesley students about what their experiences buying/selling items at Wellesley, and for their opinion and experience with Free &amp; For Sale, Wellesley's current most popular buying and selling platform. For each interviewee’s response, I created an empathy map and found these essential takeaways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The only convenient way to buy things at Wellesley is online delivery, mostly from Amazon.</li>
                            <li>Free &amp; For Sale is difficult to access for those who are not familiar with Facebook or do not use it regularly.</li>
                            <li>Users find Free &amp; For Sale unorganized as a lack of a feed customization feature makes it difficult to see relevant posts and a lack of post structure makes it difficult to see information easily.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>My next step was to create user profiles for the average Sellesley user based on the information I received via interview. Brief descriptions of each user profile are below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Kailee:</b> a student at Wellesley who travels lightly to/from her home in California. Kailee wants to buy second-hand goods for a low price and minimize her carbon footprint. She finds the F&amp;FS Facebook group hard to navigate, the town of Wellesley to be too expensive, and lives on the East side of campus and does not want to go to Lulu (Wellesley's student center) to pick up packages.</li>
                            <li><b>Charlie:</b> a senior at Wellesley preparing to move out of the dorms for good. She wants to get rid of belongings she no longer needs while making some extra money to help fund her move. Charlie sells handmade jewelry on campus but finds it difficult to get exposure for her small business.</li>
                            <li><b>Jiyoo:</b> enjoys cutting and dyeing hair and wants to provide her services to other Wellesley students as a cheap alternative to the more expensive options around Wellesley. Jiyoo wishes there was a central place to promote her services as the F&amp;FS group only allows physical items to be posted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="develop">
                        <h4>PART 2: SCENARIOS, WIREFRAME PROTOTYPE, AND USER TESTING</h4>
                        <p>After coming up with our different personas and tasks, we developed three specific scenarios that represent precise interactions we want our users to be able to have with the app:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Kailee is scrolling through the app, hoping to find a new pair of shoes. She comes across Charlie’s listing of a pair of red Vans shoes which happens to be in her shoe size and price range. She attempts to contact Charlie to set up a meeting place and time to make the transaction.</li>
                            <li>Charlie creates a batch of lovely green glass bead necklaces in her dorm room and wants to share them with the Wellesley community while simultaneously earning some side money. She posts her green necklaces as a listing under the “on-campus small business” page of the app and includes that she has an inventory of 30 necklaces. She waits to see if her posting attracts any customers.</li>
                            <li>Kailee is scrolling through the services portion of the app and comes across Jiyoo’s listing of cheap and convenient haircuts. Kailee realizes that she hasn’t cut her hair since fall of her freshman year, when she attempted to cut it in her dorm room by herself. She realizes she needs a haircut, but this time with a seasoned hair-dresser. Kailee interacts with the listing to contact Jiyoo and make an appointment for a bob haircut.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                         
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="develop">
                        <h4>PART 3: HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h4>

                        <h4>PART 4: DESIGN RATIONALE &amp; FINAL PROTOTYPE (FIGMA)</h4> 
                        <p><b>Typography:</b> The font used throughout the Sellesley app is Inter, a clean, simple, and easily readable sans-serif font that works with a variety of styles (bolded, semi-bolded, italicized, etc).<br>
                        <b>Color Scheme:</b> Sellesley’s color scheme consists of a soft blue, light gray, and pale yellow. A soft blue was chosen to be the primary color as blue is Wellesley College’s official school color and Sellesley’s intended audience is Wellesley students. Unlike Wellesley’s vibrant navy blue, Sellesley’s blue is much more diluted, making it more welcoming and relaxing to look at. The secondary color is a light gray that helps separate components in the UI from the soft blue while not contrasting it too much. A pale yellow is used as the highlighting color as it contrasts the blue and gray well and pops out to the user, emphasizing important information in our UI.
