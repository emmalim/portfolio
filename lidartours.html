                    <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
                    <p><em>LiDARTours (2022)</em> is a project I worked on with Artemios Kayas, Kate MacVicar '23, and Annissa Mu '24 for the 2022 MLH WHACKATHON (Wellesley College’s annual Hackathon). The theme of this hackathon was Connection and Wellness. LiDARTours allows users to explore rooms virtually, removing the hassle and time commitment of traveling to see a space in-person. Our project was awarded the <b>Most Ambitious Hack</b>.</p>
                
                    <p><b>Tools:</b> Blender &#8226; Sketchfab &#8226; Polycam</p>

                    <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>

                        <b>PART 1: 3D SCANNING</b>
                        <p>One member of the team's iPhone 13 Pro has a built-in lidar scanner so 3D scans were made of the room using the Polycam app on that phone. As a team, we were very impressed by the quality of the scans and how detailed some of the smaller objects in the room appeared. The first scan showed an abundance of imperfections, including distorted objects, blurred areas, and duplicated objects. We also noticed that scanning reflective surfaces would create the most distortion. The second scan was completed at a much slower pace than the first scan to get as much detail as possible, but there are still imperfections that can be seen in the demo video.</p>

                        <b>PART 2: UPLOAD TO BLENDER AND IMPLEMENTING IN VR</b> 
                        <p>Once the scan was uploaded to Sketchfab, I downloaded the model and imported it into Blender to make small edits and clean the model. The original plan was to then import the Blender model into Unity as an asset and be able to teleport around/interact with small objects in the room but the model kept importing without the texture. This issue was difficult to resolve as there is a lack of online documentation regarding moving 3D scans from Blender to Unity. As we could no longer implement LiDARTours using Unity, we resorted to using Blender's VR feature. Unfortunately, this meant that we were not able to include some extra functionality, such as pop-up text and interactable objects, into the project as we had planned.</p>

                        <b>PART 3: CLEANING THE 3D MODEL</b> 
                        <p>Once I figured out how to implement the project in VR, I tried to clean up the 3D model to fix some of the blatant imperfections. As our team was unfamiliar with how to navigate Blender, smoothing out some of the areas that were rendered with less detail proved to be a challenge. Most of the major imperfections were fixed, though part of the ceiling, the side of the desk, and the chair are lacking in quality compared to the rest of the room. With more time and with a deeper understanding of how Blender works, it would be better to have the model as clean as possible to make the environment as realistic as possible.</p>
